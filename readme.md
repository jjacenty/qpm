**Welcome to QPM**

QPM (QAC based Project Manager) is the Open Source continuation of the QAC
application developed by CarozoDeQuilmes (inspired on the MPM utility
designed by Roberto LÃ³pez, the creator of Harbour MiniGUI library).

QPM is a project manager for software applications
based on Harbour and xHarbour languages and its contributions, specialy the
graphic support libraries for Windows: Harbour MiniGUI, Harbour MiniGUI Extend
and Object Oriented Harbour GUI (OOHG), and Borland, Pelles and MinGW C/C++
compilers.

It assists programmers in the processes of program writing, compilation, debugging 
and linking by offering interactive and batch tools to:

+ Access external utilities to edit fonts, forms, headers and DBF files.
+ Keep and recover previous versions of modified files (hot recovery function).
+ View and search source files, forms, headers, and DBF files.
+ Incrementally compile GUI, console, and mixed-type programs.
+ View error files resulting from compilation and execution.
+ View .PPO files (preprocessor output).
+ Execute post-build processes.
+ Create CHM and HTML help files.
+ Create static libraries and DLL access interfaces.
+ Show the names of the functions included in static and dynamic libraries.
+ Compress EXE files with the UPX utility.
